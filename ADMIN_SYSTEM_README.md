}
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Start Development Server
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\somaa\Desktop\travelclone - Copy"
npm run dev
```

### 2. Access Admin Portal
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/admin`

### 3. Login
Use your admin credentials to access the dashboard

### 4. Navigate Between Pages
Use the top navigation menu to switch between:
- **Dashboard** - View trip requests
- **Add Activity** - Create new activities
- **Update Activity** - Edit existing activities
- **Create Invoice** - Generate invoices
- **Check Invoice** - View invoice status

## üîó Integration with Main Page

### Invoice Quick Pay Integration
When an invoice is created:
1. Invoice page shows the created invoice details
2. Auto-redirects to payment link or main page
3. Main page `InvoiceQuickPay` component can accept `?ref=INVOICE_REF` parameter
4. Users can paste invoice reference anywhere on the main page
5. Invoice details display with payment options

### Example Flow
```
Admin creates invoice ‚Üí LW-2025-0042 generated
‚Üì
Auto-redirect to: /?ref=LW-2025-0042
‚Üì
Main page InvoiceQuickPay detects reference
‚Üì
Fetches and displays invoice details
‚Üì
User can proceed to payment
```
